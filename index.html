                        <p>
                            Bruce Lee was born on <strong>November 27, 1940, in San Francisco, California</strong>.<br> 
                            He began his acting career as a child in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, appearing in several 
                            films before moving to the <strong>United States</strong> to pursue his education and develop 
                            his martial arts skills.<br>
                            Bruce Lee's early exposure to the film industry came through his father, a famous 
                            Cantonese opera star, which allowed him to appear in over 20 films by the age of 18. <br>
                            His passion for martial arts led him to study <strong>Wing Chun</strong> under the legendary <strong>Ip Man</strong> in Hong Kong. <br>
                            After returning to the United States in 1959, Bruce enrolled at the <strong>University of Washington</strong>, where he 
                            began teaching martial arts. <br>
                            This period marked the beginning of his journey to revolutionize martial arts, blending traditional 
                            techniques with his own philosophy.

                    <p>
                        Lee's breakthrough role came in 1966 with the television series 
                        <strong>"The Green Hornet"</strong>, where he played Kato, the Green Hornet's sidekick.<br> 
                        Although the show was short-lived, it introduced Lee's incredible 
                        martial arts abilities to American audiences.

                        Disappointed with the lack of leading roles in Hollywood,

                    <h3><span class="h3-emoji">ðŸ‘Š</span> Philosophy and Martial Arts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beyond his illustrious film career, Bruce Lee was a profound thinker 
                        who developed his own martial arts philosophy, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_kune_do" target="_blank">Jeet Kune Do</a>.<br>
                        This approach emphasized adaptability, efficiency, and practical combat, 
                        urging practitioners to be fluid and formless in their technique. <br>
                        Lee believed in the importance of being open to all styles, taking what was useful 
                        and discarding what was not, which he encapsulated in his famous saying, <strong>'Be Water, My Friend.'</strong><br>
                        This metaphor reflects his philosophy of being adaptable and flexible, 
                        flowing like water to overcome any obstacle. <br>
                        Lee's teachings continue to inspire and guide martial artists and thinkers worldwide, 
                        transcending the boundaries of combat to offer insights into life itself.
