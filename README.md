# CodeAcademy-HTML-CSS-Exercices
This repository contains a website created to practice the HTML and CSS lessons from CodeAcademy. It has been built with a focus on practice rather than design. While it may not look polished, it serves as a valuable tool for honing my skills, and I plan to use it for further practice in the future.

## Why Bruce Lee?
I have a deep appreciation for Chinese culture, and I thought it would be more interesting and challenging to create a blog on a topic that aligns with my interests rather than constructing a project on a random subject. Bruce Lee, as an iconic figure in both Chinese culture and martial arts, serves as a fitting inspiration for this project.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- VSCode

## Main Problems Encountered
- ### Responsive Design:
  The website doesn't adapt well to tablets or phones. I need to work on improving its responsiveness.
- ### Code Organization:
  My code feels messy and could benefit from some refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.

## Future Plans
- Enhance the design and aesthetics of the website.
- Improve the site's responsiveness across different devices.
- Clean up and organize the codebase.
- Add more content and functionality as I progress in my learning.
