# CodeAcademy-HTML-CSS-Exercices
This is a website created for practicing CodeAcademie's lessons.
It has been built with practice in mind, not design. It's ugly, but I still intend to use it to practice on a later date.

## Why Bruce Lee?
I love chinese culture and I thought it would be more interesting and challenging for me to create a blog on something that meet my interests instead of constructing a project on some random thing. 

## Main Problems I encounter
- The website doesn't adapt well to tablets or phones. Have to work on that.
- My code feels messy. Have to clean it.

## More to come...
